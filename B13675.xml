            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

No sure, (why then I write to no body.)</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177626:6"/>
            <p>To wander, properly signifies, That the party (so walking) has gone right, but then stayes, as she pe doe, leaping out of their fold; If it be so? then sure there be wandring Christians: but how many sorts of wandring Christians are there, almost as many as there are men: For go no further then this kingdome, all that are called men, are not Christians, and all that are called Christians, are not men.</p>
            <p>Wandring Christians there are then, yes: how many great men have in this land wandred from their Loyalty? yet their heads met it in the end sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a blocke, how many brave Souldiers have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the true noble Discipline military, in stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of their victories with the barbarous effusion of too much blood, where mercy cryed aloud to sheath their swords; how many profound Schollers have been walking Candles, (not lighted) or if light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have put out their owne flames and gone away stinking? how many deepe Lawyers have left the pathes of equitie to wander in the way of Bribes? how many rich men at this houre wander in the crooked windings of Extortion? how many (borne beggers) have by knavery, subtilty, basenesse, false weights, false measures, darke Lanthornes (false lights) wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred into wealth? how many wisemen wander to the
<pb facs="tcp:177626:4"/> house of folly? how many husbands wander from their wives beds? how many wives from their husbands: and are not all these Christians? yes: wandring Christians. Art thou a Courtier? art thou a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? art thou a Merchant? art thou a Shop-keeper? art thou a good man? art thou a bad? Reade what is written in the Iews face, and thou mayst prove a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christian, be what thou wilt: If thou desires to foresee what shall befall thee upon this Booke, if thou canst not finde the full weight of thy fortune yet in one scale or other there lies a dramme; there's a Iewes Lottery, and lots of severall valuations: No blanks, all prizes; Injoy them, and the love of him who bids thee draw, and wishes thee a noble fortune.</p>

            <head>THE WANDRING IEVV, <hi>TELLING FORTƲNES to English-men,</hi> OR, A IEWES LOTTERY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing melancholy, and walking in a warme afternoone to <hi>Hogsdon</hi> alone, I fell into a by-path, which led me into a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary field, fit to the disposition of my mind. There I lay on a bancke, and on a sudden, had mine eye-lids so long plaid upon with a golden slumber, that in the end it turn'd to a sound sleep, which so long inchanted me by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching charmes, that the Birds in pitty, to see me lye there, and fearing I might catch hurt by the cold fingers of the night, if once they fastned upon me, the poore fingers, set out a throat, to wake me
<pb facs="tcp:177626:7"/> and sat up later than their houre, onely to watch me. I then awak'd, and prais'd heaven, for putting more pitty into the brest of a gentle Bird, than into man.</p>
            <p>So, darkenesse martching softly towards the City, I thrust my selfe into her company, and went along with her: when I came to the walkes of Moorefields, <hi>I</hi> feard nothing, for I saw none, I heard none, met none, all was hush'd as a still water, no wind stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, no leaves bustling; (that halfe amaz'd) I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgot where I was, on in the darke, I went I knew not how, nor car'd I whither: in the end, I got to More-gate, but that, and all the other passages were stopt, lock'd up, and none to open; for there was a tumult in London, upon which the gates were shut, and the Lord Maior, and Sherifs, with power gon abroad to keepe the peace. From Moregate then I softly went up the field againe, it was not earely and it was not late, I heard no voyces of man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I saw no light, and thought with my selfe, that all that part of the world was drunke, they were so fast a sleepe.</p>
            <p>In the end, I spy'd a small light burning in a great window, which shew'd like one Glow-worme in a large garden: be the house (quoth I to my selfe) what it will, there will I knocke; for albeit the gates be shut, Constables eyes are open: so I came to a faire porch, whose dore within was but put to: in I went, and on I went, (it being as I after understood) one of those spatious bricke-houses, which shoot their smoake towards Bun-hill; when ther's any fire in the chimneis. What the silent walkes were, I feard not, and who the dweller there I car'd not: a pretty
<pb facs="tcp:177626:7"/> strippling presently comes out with a candle, and without any more complement told me, his master would doe nothing to night, no more telling of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes till morning, I catching hold of this, asked who was his master, he said the <hi>Wandring Iew,</hi> where is he, (quoth I) within (quoth he): may I speake with him (quoth I) you may (quoth he;) does hee dwell here (quoth I?) no, he but lyes here, (quoth he,) it his kinsmans house, and he being in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, rather then it should stand empty, gives him the use of it.</p>
            <p>At last, lighting me into a faire Parlor, I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where was a good fire, and an antient Gentleman, in an odde Jewish habit, sitting at a table, where hee had newly sup'd; hee spying me sat still, and spoke not a word, at which I was abashed; yet plucking up a good heart: Sir (said I) by your strange outside, I know not what language you speake, but if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that which I speake (English,) I intreate so noble a favour at your hands, as to let me shelter my selfe in your house, till the Moone pleases to shine, and bestow one of her Tapers upon me to light me to my lodging. He call'd for a chaire, and made me sit downe by him; and then (taking me by the hand,) sonne (said he) y'are well-come: I have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled farre, and speake many languages, yet am as you are, an Englishman, (you may heare by my tongue.) If I spake nothing at your comming in, wonder not, it is my fashion, as they (which know me) know. For why should I to one I never saw, moove needlesse questions, which you may answer as you please, and deride me: say I aske you, where you
<pb facs="tcp:177626:8"/> have beene, and why you walke so late, what need you tell me? you may speake any thing. To desire what you are, where you dwell, what's your quality, who your friends? this were superfluous &amp; ridiculous.</p>
            <p>If you be my friend, to use you unkindly, were base: if my enemy, yet in such a night, to well-come you, is charity, if you are capable of my harmelesse meaning, you shall know more ere you part, Sir, (said I,) if I could not pay your kindnesse with loving words, you might count me a bad debtor, if I study not to require your courtesie, I were ungratefull, (and then a villaine,) but sithence, it is not in my power to performe so much now, it shall argue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous disposition in you, if for a short time you give me forbearance, till I be better able: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I seeme rude, by this bold intrusion, yet have I beene trayned up where good manners grew, and learning florished.</p>
            <p>I vvas once my selfe a lover of the Muses too, (said he) but had a roaming head when I vvas as you are, yong, and vvould take no settled course, and that caus'd mee to travell: but vvhen the rod of youth had beaten me, and that age bid me hye home; I returned to mine owne Country <hi>(Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> vvhose smoake to me, vvas more sweet, than all the perfum'd fires, by which I warm'd my selfe abroad.</p>
            <p>To this house have I retir'd, because it stands in a good ayre, hath the benefit of faire prospects, and is neere the Citty, it is none of mine but my kinsmans, yet may I use it as freely as if it were mine owne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177626:8"/>
            <p>And now sonne, (for so my age allowes me privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to call you) I will take away the tediousnesse of night, by some discourse, of the passages of my owne life. Every old man is his owne Chronicler, and no story is readier in his memory then what hee writes with his owne hand.</p>
            <p>Know then, that in my first setting forth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse through the world, much preferment met me, kiss'd me, and wood me, and faine would have had me, but I would none: choyce of wives were set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, (beauties able to tempt) yet me they could not: I saw others, that had faire wives, but the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands looked worse than othermen: I had a fresh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they pale, I strong and lusty, they puling; weake and sickly, I joviall, buxome, and still merry, they sullen, melancholy, and ever sad. No wife (I swore for this) should come neere me. I could have beene rich, but all rich men, are not the happiest men; if I might live (said I) alwayes, I vvould then build (as rich men doe) and set my glory on the toppes of Pinnacles, but vvhen vvith my hand I could measure out the spanne of a poore transitory life, I accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gold and silver, but as the misers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to cast up his cares by; Honours I vveighed, and found the Ballance false; when I thought they had beene Dyamonds, they proved Pibbles; vvhen cuppes of Nectar, they turn'd to roming vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The embracing of the sweetest vvoman upon earth, but a Goddesses picture, a minutes pleasure, an age of perturbation.</p>
            <p>So that, fanning off these light fethers, I sit as you, by my owne fire; if now I appeare wretched, my
<pb facs="tcp:177626:9"/> griefe is the lesse, because I was never better, if I am poore, no matter, it is sometimes a torment to be rich. As I have not too much, I have not too little, I am the Sunne to my owne Zodiack, or a ship in my own sea, and beare a sayle according to my burthen.</p>
            <p>But now I will open to you the booke of a strange secrecy, here I live as obscure as I can, yet the needle-eye of this winking world has found mee out, and for what thinke you? They take me for a rare fellow, a Conjurer, a Cunning-man, a sooth-sayer, a figure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a starre-catcher, a Fortune-teller, any body, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, and <hi>I</hi> know not who, neither can they tell what.</p>
            <p>Indeed (worthy Sir) I confesse I have heard, that here about Moore-fields, such a wondrous man did live, that was as well acquainted with the Moone, as her neighbours the starres are, but that this was the house, I protest I knew not, till by this good fortune, a happy darkenesse brought me to it. For Sir, you have such a winning way in you, that <hi>I</hi> desire (as you call me son) so I may call you father, and be adopted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decred into your grave acquaintance.</p>
            <p>This night (replyed hee) you shall lodge here, to morrow morning, you shall see the Terme begin, my Clients will come in tumbling; not that I can doe them any good, (for alas I have no such skill) yet talke with them I doe, all commers <hi>I</hi> well-come; it is my sport to heare them tell their lamentable sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and it addes to my experience, to see the vanities, follies, and fooleries of this age, in believing that man can cut out fortunes, for such Ideots, and to thrust himselfe into the knowledge of his great master. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night rings her bell in mine eare, and bids us hasten to
<pb facs="tcp:177626:9"/> bed: my Boy shall conduct you to yours; good rest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you: when you rise, you shall see strangers enow wayting here, to give you and me our breakefasts.</p>
            <p>The gray morning had no sooner opened her eyes, but <hi>I</hi> (with mine open) saluted her, and though I would have sworne I had beene the first up in the house, yet when I came out of my chamber, I found my old-new-father, by a good fire, fitting in his chaire, as soberly as <hi>Erra Pater:</hi> his beard was reverend, face comely, a Jewish gowne girt to him, and a Jewish round cap on his head, buskins on his legges, a small silver bell lying before him, to ring for his boy, mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens upon his hands.</p>
            <p>His courtesie (over night) made me bold with him in the morning, so that I prayd him, honour me so much, as to let me know the name, to which I was so infinitely beholden, and withall, why (being an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man) hee was call'd the <hi>Wandring Iew,</hi> and a tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Fortunes. Both your questions (quoth hee) shall come home to you, answered.</p>
            <p>I have beene a Traveller many yeares, and felt the heate of the Sunne in change of Countries: at my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Venice, I came acquainted with an Italian Jew named <hi>Orletto,</hi> whom meeting often upon the <hi>Rialta,</hi> diverse Venetians noting his face and mine, said we were so like, wee might very easily be taken for brothers; the Jew being told this, sent for me to his house, entertain'd me with curious complements, curtesie and cheere, making mee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow (for the equall likenesse we both carryed,) to call him brother. Nay, he did so affect my company, (I speaking as good pure Tuscane as he himselfe) and discoursing home
<pb facs="tcp:177626:10"/> with him, that he wonne me to sojourne with him; &amp; in the end, (because I strove to please and humour him in all things, his noble curtesies, binding me to doe so) he vvrought me to goe in a rich Jewish ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit (such as you see I sit in) so that all Venice swore I vvas his brother, and I vvent (as he did,) by the name of <hi>Orlot to,</hi> vvhich name I retaine here still, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit my ovvn true name is <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To your other demand, vvhy I am called a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller, a Cunning-vvise-man, and I knovv not what; this addition of ridiculous Title came to me, by a merry accident, which fell out thus. A singing joviall Cobler, dwelt not farre from a private lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I tooke; who bore such love to a rough-hayre Water-spaniell which hee kept, hee was never well, but vvhen the Dogge was in his company. A mad fellow to have some sport vvith the Coblar, stole the Dogge, and kept him close from him a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennight: the Cobler was mad, and sware he did not care to give all the shooes in his shop, to have his Dogge againe: why (sayes the other) I vvill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for a Capon and a pottle of wine, to bring you to a Jew hard by, (an excellent Scholler, and seene in the Black-art, that shall helpe you to the Curre. Tis agreed; the mad Grig then comes to me, (being full in my acquaintance,) and for mirth sake, wooes me when I brought the Cobler to him, to undertake the getting of his Dog, vvhich was easie to doe, he having him lock'd up in his owne house, I yeelded: he brings the Cobler, and after many intreaties (I tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the danger of the Law, if I dealt in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) at length, I promis'd him I would doe my best.
<pb facs="tcp:177626:10"/> Asking him then, if hee could reade, hee said, No: hereupon, taking downe <hi>Gesners</hi> discourse of Beasts, vvith their pictures, I turn'd to that part vvhich reveales the properties of all sorts of Dogges: shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the picture of one, Is this hee? No; Is this hee? No, no: I then (after hee had seene many others) opened the leafe, where the picture of a shag-haire Water-spaniell was, which he no sooner saw, but rapping out a great oath, swore, that vvas the very svveet face of his deare Diver (for so hee called his Curre:) upon which opening his purse, hee threw downe all his mony, and so hee might but see his Dogge at home, bid me take what I would: I touched none, but bidding him hie to his house, told him his Dogge should be at home within halfe an houre, with great joy he parts, his friend gets home, powres a kettle of warme water on the Dogge, as if hee swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cudgel'd the Curre soundly, and away runnes hee to the Cobler, leaping upon his master, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hugging him: And upon this was I so fam'd for my cunning, that there is not a morning in the weeke, but I am haunted with fooles of all stampes, to know their fortunes, in which I have as much skill, as the Coblers Water-spaniell had; yet I make a shift to please my selfe, and not hurt them: I wonder I sit so long quiet; stay you by me, (if you can have patience) and behold what Actors enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Comicall stage.</p>
            <p>By this time, one knoc'd, hee whisled for his other halfe of the house-hold, which was a pretty sprightly boy, which lighted mee in, whom (the

                  <p>THe Tobacconist being gone without any loud beating at the gates, <hi>Ioculo</hi> came roaring to his Master, and told him there was entred a comely grave old Gentleman, were he bald, I should take him for Time; It's a Westminster-man sure, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177626:15"/> he's gowned, and as I gather, a Lawyer, by a man following him with a Buckram bagge at his side, see sir, hee's come.</p>
                  <p>The Lawyer being in sight of <hi>Orlotto,</hi> and each of them looking wishly (as amaz'd) one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the English Jew (as abash'd) suddenly start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, ranne to embrace him, who lifting up his hands, (being strucke with admiration,) My old friend Mr. Egremont (quoth he) and are you the wandring Jew, you the rare cunning-man, you the Fortune-teller? I heard of a superlative famous fellow, so cry'd up, that all who before you have led the World into a fooles paradise, were but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippae's</hi> shadowes dancing in a circle, to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which the wandring Jew walks in: and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such a prize, you know it is my fashion to come and see it, not that I desire to be told my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or that I beleeve any Jew, Gipsen, Witch, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer, or Star-gazer, is so familiar with the secret counting house of heaven. The lockes and wards of Fate, are not so easie to be opened: silly women, and unexperienced people, (out of the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of custome,) do, or may happily resort to you and others, about strayed cattle, or lost goods; but I know how high your crosse-staff reaches, and that all is but Jugling, falsity, and imposturisme.</p>
                  <p>Worthy Sir, (said <hi>Orletto</hi>) all this I know too, and neither am skilled, nor professe I any of these cunny-catching sciences; (Sciences! let mee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse so excellent a name) they are meere gulleries: onely, here I sit, and if any comes to me (as this yong Gentleman can testifie) I make my selfe merry
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:177626:15"/> by discoursing with them, but few are pleas'd yet, with any Fortune, which I have read to them.</p>
                  <p>No! I pray let me understand your mysterious handling of your Clients, Patients, or Customers, (I know not how you terme them) and in the same Dialect, that you Lecture out Fortunes to others, let me have mine.</p>
                  <p>You shall Sir, (replied old Egremont) those on whom I worke, I either know their dispositions by conference with them, or else (good soules) they are so open-hearted to mee, that they anatomize themselves in their owne characters, and is not this an easie way then, to throw away a true fortune up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them? As, a fellow comes to me, and tells mee, hee's a Thiefe, and would know his fortune; Can I tell him any other fortune, but to be hang'd, if he leaves not his trade? A common baggage tells me how she lives by the use of her body, can I tell her any other, than to die in an hospitall? But (noble Sir,) to make you merry, I will tell you yours: I know you be a learned Lawyer, and that which is better, an honest man, so that the kingdome gives you the stile of a good Lawyer, (that is to say, a good man,) Law is your studie, but your pleadings are to get honour, in the Star-chamber of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Justice dares hardly trust some Lawyers; but into your hands, shee thrust her scales, because with a steddy hand you weigh rich and poore in an even Ballance: Were all Lawyers of your minde, It would be a continuall vacation; the Foure Termes might sleepe among the Tombes, and Westminster live without noise; for you more delight in ending

                  <p>Your beard you suffer to grow long, because it being white, should still put you in minde to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unworthily, such a reverend ornament. Oft have I heard you say, that when you saw but a cloth laid on a table it put you in mind of a coarse; and when you fed, O (quoth you) thus doe I fatten my selfe for wormes, that so they may feed upon me.

I live among Ladies, see beauties every day; waite on a Knight, eat good meat every meale; and meet with brave ragges (my Knights Tayler cuts out for me) as he does for him: his Caroch is sometimes mine, his Taverne-drinkings mine, his Playes at Black-friers, or Cock-pit mine: whatsoever is his at first hand, is mine at second: (his wenches now and then before him) yet what of all this; this is no Sea to maintaine mee for ever in fishing: Service is but a glowing fire, it heats, but not through; I beseech you therefore tell me when I shall sit by a bouncing Sea-coale fire of mine owne Fortune, not to go out from Winters end, to Winters end. And I am your Servant, <hi>Durante vita.</hi>

                  <p>It is no shame to Serve; for One serves all us: Would you rise higher then you are? drinking stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or domineering proudly cannot do't. Are you in a good Service? keepe it; least when you would have such another, you goe without it; would you thrive? catch Time by the shoulder, for if you let him passe by, hee comes no more at your call: for Time, though hee bee an old man, is an excellent footman; no Shockatory comes neere him if hee once get the start, hee's gone, and you gone too. If you gather no eares of Corn in the Summer of your youth, in the Winter of Age, you shall eat no bread; but either leape at a crust, and begge or starve: and then if Povertie and Age walke together, every foot-boy shall looke over the shoulder at you; and every Scullion in your Ladies Kitchin jeere you; scorn'd as an old Woman that was wonton in her youth: Then all your fine fegawes will be rip d up, and all your follies laid in your dish: have you at any time done wrong? now it will bee reveng'd in your want and weaknesse: When an old Lion had never a tooth in's head, then the Asse bit him. Are you in a good place? strive to deserve it: what you get, keep; what you spend, make use of: Are you trusted? deceive not such a Master: By this small harvest, you may gather golden sheaffes enough to fill your little Barne; So fare you well. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man offered him halfe his quarters wages, but he would none, and away out at gate he went.</p>

Feare makes you foolish; and a confidence that your Wife is false, leaves you distrustfull. Cannot a Woman be hansome, but shee's a Harlot? can she not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but she playes foule? But say your feares were true, why do you torment your Soule, when ther's no remedy? Sores past Cure, should be past Care; that which is done, cannot be undone: If she be a good wife, you wrong her to make her bad; If she
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177626:28"/> be bad, all your raving cannot make her good; it is not the worke of man, such wonders are wrought by Heaven. Is she (for all your idle and causelesse Jealousie) Chast? why then, no woing can tempt her, no gold overcome her, no pleasure poyson her, no peevishnesse of yours, make her crooked. But if she will be loose, you shall never binde her; if she will, she will. Locks shall not barre her, nor Doores imprison her, nor Stone-walls ram her up; if her minde hath wings, over will she flie, and her body shall mount.</p>
                  <p>Your Fortune therefore is; If you cannot alter your beliefe, then you shall be your owne Martyr, still living in torments, never-dying in them, till they and you die together: your body shall grow leane with fretting; your face pale with your feares; your goods melt away by your carelessenesse; yet you full of Care: Age will clap you on the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whil'st you are yong, and your head grow white before you are old. Your Children you will not love, because you suspect they are Bastards: your meat you will hardly touch, mistrusting shee will poyson it: you shall never be merry at heart, never sleepe soundly, never sit, but sigh; never walke, but distracted; And never die, but in despaire to leave her to any other, whom you so desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse to your selfe. Your best way, is to thinke the best, and judge the best. —Ptrooh (cryed he) Beware-Hornes, and so, like an Oxe, broke loose and ran out at gate.</p>

                  <p>A Witch, is the Devills Otter-hound, living both on Land and Sea, and doing mischiefe in either; she kills more beasts, then a licensed Butcher in Lent, yet is nere the fatter; shee's but a dry Nurse for the Flesh, yet gives suck to the Spirit. A Witch! rides many times poast on hellish businesses, yet if a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der do but stop her, shee'll be hang'd ere shee goes any further. In all her life-time shee has but one Cause tryed at Law, and where others pay for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, she findes such dispatch, that in three or foure dayes at most, she hath both Judgement and Execution come forth.</p>
                  <p>A Hangman is the last man she parts with, from whom if she askes any thing, he puts her off: when her life is weighing Anchor, and hoy sing Saile, her ship (the Conscience) is of a great burden, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse she hath mighty helpe to cast all her Sinnes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Board, her lading is lost forever, in turning of a hand.

                  <head>The Banckrupts speech.</head>
                  <p>LEarned Jew, wisedome ever attend you; sir, I am a Citizen, and my ambition is, to beare up the reputation of such a name: I love to swimme, but it is death for me to sink; to be call'd a wealthy Citizen, is my minde, as great an honour as to bee call'd <hi>Bethlem-Gabor,</hi> or <hi>Spinola,</hi> or <hi>Tilley,</hi> they fight for glory, (and we Citizens strive for Riches) and is more glorious, than to muster an Army of golden angels on a Table.</p>
                  <p>The secrets of many Trades I know; and their od wayes, tricks, devices, pollicies, knaveries to get money; and none dare tax them: none will, because all (for the most part) are Black-a-Mores as well as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177626:33"/> themselves: who in an Hospitall, will upbraid his fellow with my disease, when hee that reviles the other, lies himselfe there sick of the Pox? I, seeing this corruption in all Professions, doe not greatly care to be corrupt too: being among Crows, why should not I bee ravenous, and learne to pecke out eyes? when all the people in the World are Doves, then will I be a Turtle.</p>
                  <p>Some care not whom they undoe, so they may scrape Pelfe together; I think therefore it is no great sinne to undoe the undoers. A voluntary Banckrupt then is a necessary member in a City; a sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to punish offenders; a good Ant before-hand in Summer to bee armed for Winter: an indulgent nurse to himself, and a carefull Father to his Family. Is it not a wretched reproach for a man, a Citizen, a great Trader, a busie Shop-keeper to leave his Wife poor, and his Children beggars? that scandall will I fan off from mine, and my posterity: for (Jew) I am not asham'd to tell you, that I have playd the Jew with my Christian-brother Citizens, have got into my hands the goods of many, to enrich one, (that's my selfe;) what care I for being call'd Banckrupt: why should <hi>Ludgate</hi> be more disgrace to me than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Gate? do I not see a company of brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows live there? are not their fine Wives, as merry with them there, as at home? have they not Pasties of Venison there, and bottles of Wine upon bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? are they not full of Gold and Silver? can they not lye at their owne houses, when they list, and walke abroad when they list; if there be not the clogge of an Execution tyed to their legge?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177626:34"/> who then would not breake? who would not lie there? O! but to lie there, and spend other mens money! doe not all Shop-keepers, that sweare and lie put off bad Commodities, spend others estates so too?</p>
                  <p>I would gladly therefore (O noble Jew) bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from your knowledge in the influences of the Stars, what Fortune shall be mistresse over these goods, thus gotten; and what honor I may raise my selfe and Children to, if the goods can bee kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                  <p>TO whom the Jew thus replyed, to take a Purse by the High-way, albeit it bee manly, yet it is villany: he yet ventures his life in the taking of it, and his neck, when it is taken; a traveller may bee arm'd against such a mischiefe: the Thiefe robs but one; O! but to get mens goods, by a faire way of friendly trading; and then to impoverish the owner of them, what robbery is like it: there are many wayes to prevent a Thiefe, a voluntary Banckrupt, none. Such a Land-Pirat steals not from one, but from hundreds; he does undoe Towns in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if he deales with Chapmen, whole streets in the City; whole Families in severall Parishes. What Fortune now, thinke you, can attend upon such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This Fortune, and this shall be yours.</p>
                  <p>If either by cozenage, tricks in Law, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divellish net; you goe a fishing for other mens estates, you shall have the curse of masters of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the wo-worths of mothers; the lack-and-well-adaes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177626:34"/> of Children; and the bitter execrations of Servants. You shall bee all your life-time counted but a Thiefe, your Wife pointed at, for jetting in stolne feathers; and your children hated worse than Bastards: flourish you may a while in the World; you may laugh, drinke Wine, and be free from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, upon paying Ten groats or so in the Pound; and then you may set up againe, and breake againe; and play the Thiefe againe, but the hanging comes in the end.</p>
                  <p>You Break, and 'tis a proper word, for you break the hearts of undone Citizens; what follows? when you come to die, there's no breaking away then; to come to die, makes a foole of all your cunning; all your cozenage: to come to die, puzzels the most politicke Banckrupt; hee's never put to his trumps but at that hour: It is the terrible reckoning (then) the fearfullest casting up what every mans Ware comes to, whom you have cheated; the hardest les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that flesh and bloud can take forth: you shall on your death-bed Rave, and Sweare you see undone Orphans crying, and wringing their hands; your sinnes will stand round about you: conscience (all spotted) ringing one Bell in your right eare, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, another in the left: hell gaping for his share, the grave for his; and then if an arme Omnipotent flings not by the Curtains, to take you by the hand, with a voice; crying, Restore thy stolne goods; and then come away, and fear nothing: what a mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And what doe we, when lovingly we embrace a mans middle; wee come behinde him, because wee would not fright him too much; and to shew wee are good subjects, we Arrest all in the Kings name.</p>
                  <p>Arrest! O sweet word!

                  <p>LOoke out Boy (said <hi>Orlotto</hi>) Another knocks. I see (quoth <hi>Ioculo</hi>) a man, and a Head stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon shoulders, but it has no face, That's muff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a Cloake lined through with Velvet. The Head has a long Lock, and a thick Bush, It may be a Thiefe lurks in it. See, sir, hee's come.</p>
                  <p>Are you, (said the Thiefe) that Jew so talked on for your skill? What's your businesse said <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotto?</hi>

                  <head>The <hi>Thiefes</hi> speech.</head>
                  <p>I Am then (noble Jew) a Gentleman by birth, and a younger Brother, by the sluggishnesse of my Father, who made not haste enough to beget me, before the rest of my brothers; So that having no lands left me. I make shift to pick out a living at my fingers ends. I have been a Thiefe these fifteen yeeres, and am not yet ashamed of my Occupation. Why (if I be the Kings Subject) shall not the Kings High-way allow me Maintenance, when no body else will?</p>
                  <p>I see, every Sessions, Carts full drawne up Hol-bourne, Farewell they, these are Riff-raffe Theeves, the Scum of a State, Pilferers, Pick-pockets, and Cut-purses: But a brave Purse-taker, is the Great-Turke of Cavileroes, to such bastardly Handy-Crafts.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:177626:37"/>
                  <p>To play the Thiefe, is a part studied both by Sea and Land: Men in dicing will juggle in false ones, and what's that but Thriving? All that are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Bankrupts are Theeves. How many Rich men steale to the beds of Whores? And how many faire Women, to the beds of Knaves? If then, examples can give priviledges, my Robbing is warrantable. A lusty, hardy, tall Thiefe, who (tho himselfe rides on a good Gelding, yet cryes to him whom hee meets, Stand) may be a Leader of men; for he does such Courtisies to them on the way, that he bindes them to him. All Executors that rob Orphans of their portions, are Theeves, and deserve more to be hang'd then a Purser. A Purser is a good place, in a ship, but I hold my Pursing-place better on shore. I pray, Jew, tell me whether I was not borne under <hi>Mercury,</hi> (for he is the Thiefes Planet) and what, if I continue in my Trade, I must trust too? My For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, speake quickly.</p>

                  <p>Jew, quoth he, would I had thee but on <hi>Gads-hill,</hi> I am not Noos'd yet: and so stole away as he came in, Muffled.</p>

                  <p>AS the Thiefe went out at gate, one met him.</p>
                  <p>Is there any body else, said <hi>Orlotto,</hi> Yes, said <hi>Ioculo,</hi> I see one comming, who meeting the Pursy Gallant full at gate, looked back at him, shooke his head, and lifted up one finger, as if he should say, Aha! do I know thee. What he is, let himselfe tell you, for this is the party.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The <hi>Hangmans</hi> speech.</head>
                  <p>WHich, I pray, is the Cunning-man, said he? I met a Yonker at your gate, who if he came to looke his Fortune, might have saved his labour, and found out me; I know him, and shall one day, I feare, tell him the last Fortune that ever he shall lay hold on.</p>
                  <p>Why, said <hi>Orlotto,</hi> what are you? I am, quoth he, a man that have few fellowes in <hi>England;</hi> no Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet deale altogether in Mans and Womans flesh, yet, for all that, I am no Caniball. I am the Ladder of the Law, by which many Malefactors climbe up the steps of Reformation: No grand Jury-man am I, yet sit upon life and death as often as any of them doth. A Rope-maker is my back friend, yet my man: A Carman drives my Coach, and the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>London</hi> are my guard of Billmen. I am no Gentleman borne, yet sometimes keepe Gentlemen at my heels, for I have land (a little piece of ground)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177626:38"/> on this side <hi>Paddington,</hi> and such as are my Tenants, there pay me what we bargaine for; all this descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of my selfe, shews, that albeit I met a tall rank Thiefe at your gates, yet I am a true hangman, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the City by my place, and at all Executions of Justice I am seated highest, for all the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are under me: a hangman (some thinke, 'tis a word of disgrace, a title of infamy.) What are they then that behind their backs hang one another? for my part I make peace, and draw quarrelling compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to a-Cord: your roaring Boyes whom whole streets of Constables (now and then) cannot tame, when they come under my fingers, are as hush'd as Schoole-boyes.</p>
                  <p>Why then is the trade of hanging such a reproach to me? is it not a word used in Noble-mens houses as an honour to such places, these are costly rich hangings? when a Lady is passionate, and full of sorrow; do you not say she hangs the head? do not Women hang about their husbands neckes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Children about their Mothers. This word hanging is no such scurvy <hi>English</hi> as the Gallowes-Audience take it to be; the word is ancient, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies much: to some it is a Deaths head; the very sound of the word (hanging) makes many a one that is altogether unlettered, to fall to his Booke, and learne his Neck-verse: how many base fellowes whom some thought would never have come to good, yet in my company do not only pray hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themselves, but request others to pray for them? You now know who I am, and with what Broome I use to sweepe the Common-wealth of Enormities:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177626:38"/> yet because I am hated, revil'd by crack-halters, scolded at by fish-wives, and oftentimes after an Execution, almost beaten to death by them. I pray (Mr. Jew) bestow a cast of your Office upon me (a poor member of the law) by telling me my Fortune whether I shall die in my bed, or no, or what else shal happen to me; and if ever any theeving <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> should break in upon you, I will with both hands nimbly lend a cast of my office to him.</p>

                  <p>SAyes <hi>Orlotto,</hi> I should be sorry ever to trouble you that way (in your Precinct:) what you are, I know by the woefull experience of others; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer to a violent Death; and a kind of Purveyor to him, taking up his provision, as Axes, Ropes, Cords, Knives, Gibbets, Racks, Ladders, &amp;c. your place in the garden of a State is to cut downe Briers, and pluck up Weeds: your office (if you call it an office) is, I confesse, as necessary as a Surgeons; hee cures Wounds, you Wickednes. Shall I tell you in what account a fellow of your hempen qualities is held in <hi>Germany?</hi> when he comes to take his oath, there's a new stool made for him, upon which he sits bare-headed before the Burgers (his Masters) and there laying his hand on a Book, he's sworn to betray Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, Kindred, Friend, or Foe: and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bidden to rise up (Thief-leader;) He has a kicke on the taile given him, and the stoole before his face, burnt in the fire; prepared for that purpose onely, as unfit for any other man to sit upon it; Any one that doth but drinke with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought a <hi>Schellum,</hi> and as infamous as the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177626:39"/> Carnifex himselfe, but in <hi>England</hi> you are not so branded. Would you know your Fortune? If all the World were honest, you might goe hang your selfe; for you should (else) have no Worke; the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of a City must keepe you sound; the worser the Rabble or Rogues are, the better you thrive: Witches, Traytors, and Murderers, shall be to your last day your best Benefactors; and yet for all your Wardrobes of hanged mens clothes; for all your dozen of shirts at a time made at the Gallowes, you must be content to live a Threed-bare Knave, and die a begger.</p>
                  <p>No blessing can follow such a cursed tormenter; thy dreams shall be of nothing but of wry mouthes, blabbed tongues, knots under the care, and poore tottred wretches stript and tumbled stark naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a nasty pit one upon another: Whether thou shalt die in thy bed or no, my spirits are so dogged, they will not tell me; hope the best: But if (as others of thy coate,) thou by touching Pitch continually art defiled, as they were: then be sure to take thy leave of the World like a hangman. With a looke (as if hee had beene going to the Gallowes) hee vvent avvay.</p>

                  <p>A Thiefe going off the stage but a little before, and the hangman entring presently after; who (if not Tiburne) should step in next? <hi>Ioculo</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore standing on Tipto to looke toward the Gate, was halfe afraid, shook, and grew pale: what ail'st thou (said his Master,) O sir cryed he; yonder is a Thing comming hither that is no man, and yet no monster; Hee knew the Hangman, and shooke him by the unlucky golls: It hath Three Feet, and no Head that I see, (at least no Face;) yet it weares a Three Cornered Cappe; a goodly Timberd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman it is, if it bee a Gentleman: looke, looke, (O Master,) with much adoe, it hath crowded in. The Jew was agast to behold such a motion; but then it thus spake;</p>

                     <hi>Tiburnes</hi> speech.</head>
                  <p>WOnder not Jew, nor be afrighted to see a dead Tree thus remov'd from his Centers; neither admire that I speake and have a voice, for so many comming on fatall Errands to mee from <hi>Newgate,</hi> they (at my home) loose their lives; and all their voyces flie into me. That Trees have motion, you see in every field how they wanton with the winds, that they sometimes speake. Remember <hi>Aeneas</hi> his tearing downe Boughes to prepare a Sacrifice; which Boughes ran with bloud: and then a voyce out of a Tree discovering the murder of <hi>Polidore,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:177626:40"/> who there lay buried. Remember the old verse of a Lute speaking thus;
<q>
                        <l>Alive i'th Woods, till Blowes me fell'd to'th ground,</l>
                        <l>Dumb, Living; Dead, I yeeld a heavenly sound.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOw albeit these Patterns did not priviledge mee; yet I have had to doe with so many Witches, Magitians, Conjurers, and great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; that by the Charmes (learnt from them) it is easie for mee: thus to come to you, and thus to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you.</p>
                  <p>My name is famous through <hi>England,</hi> and in other Countreys; of a long standing am I; and of great practice for that which I professe, and yet my name is not so ill as some would have it: For my right name is <hi>Tey-Bourne,</hi> and not <hi>Tiburne. Bourne,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a River; and the River <hi>Tey,</hi> runs by me, sending his loue in Pipes to <hi>Holbourne:</hi> So, <hi>Tey-bourne</hi> feeds <hi>Holbourne;</hi> and <hi>Holbourne, Tiburne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am cursed for hanging so many every Sessions; alas, I send not for them, they are brought to mee; and shall not I doe my office: I take no pleasure in mens deaths. Yet I confesse it delights mee when Carts full of Traytors (that would blow up a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) stand round about me; I have seene fine fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes on their prauncers ride by mee, shaking their wands at me, laughing and jeering mee to my face; yet within one fortnight after, I have had them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my fingers. Alas poor Tiburne, little doth the World know what I feele: I endure Haile, Snow, Frosts, Lightning, and Thunder in the day time; I am cursed, scorned, and hacked with Swords; in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177626:40"/> night the ghosts of men and women, buried there, come round about my fields groaning, and shriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wishing, those that have beene brought to the last turning off from one of my ladders, yet were repriev'd, and sent backe, to amend their courses: and counselling all such that are likely to go West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to saile by a better Compasse; and not to make my Narrow Sea their way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now, ever learned and reverend Jew; say what shall become of me, what shall I doe. What For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will the fates hang upon my shoulder.</p>
